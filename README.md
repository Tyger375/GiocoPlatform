<h3>How to start the server for multiplayer</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Download the file serverVideoGame.py</li>
  <li>If you've never done this before, install python</li>
  <li>Open the command prompt, navigate the folder where the file is located, and run the file by simply writing in the command prompt "python ./serverVideoGame"</li>
 </ol>

If you did it correctly, it should show:
```cmd
starting
server is listening on [your ip]
```
By default the port setting for the server is 5000, you can easily change it by editing the file and change the PORT variable at the beginning of the file
